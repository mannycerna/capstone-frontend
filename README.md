# Inventory MERN Application


AlphaTorro received a request from a client for a proof of concept for an inventory app.  AlphaTorro willl provide a demo of Inventory App with CRUD capabilities.  

Inventory will contain inventory data.  The Inventory App is an initial step towards automating the client's business inventory process. The ultimate goal is to replace the pen/paper process currently being utilized in keeping track of inventory.  

The minimum requirements are: 
NoSql database which will hold all of the data.  
User Interface to interact and manipulate data.
Different roles of users to segment permission of access to database.



## Installation

Will provide installation instructions at future date/time.

```bash
